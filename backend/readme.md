-I used DBeaver for managing the database install your prefered option but you need to connect the DBNAME, DBUSERNAME and DBPASSWORD. I am working with the latest version of DBeaver and postgres you just install the latest.

DBeaver download link: https://dbeaver.io/download/
postgres download link: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

-In the backend in your .env file you are going to put the DBNAME, DBUSERNAME and the DBPASSWORD after you install postgres and DBeaver
